        <p class="responsive-paragraph">HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) is a food safety management system that is used to identify and control potential hazards in the food production process. It is a preventive approach to food safety, rather than a reactive one. HACCP system is based on 7 principles: conducting a hazard analysis, determining the critical control points (CCPs), establishing critical limits, implementing monitoring procedures, establishing corrective actions, implementing verification procedures, and implementing record-keeping and documentation procedures. The main goal of HACCP is to ensure the safety of the food by reducing or eliminating the risk of food-borne hazards and illness. It is widely recognized and used in the food industry and it's also recognized by the FDA and USDA. Organizations that meet the requirements of HACCP can be certified to the standard, which demonstrates their commitment to food safety and quality.</p>
