        <p class="responsive-paragraph">ISO 50001:2018 is an international standard for Energy Management Systems (EnMS) that provides a framework for organizations to systematically manage their energy use and costs, and to improve energy efficiency. It is based on the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle, which is a continuous improvement process. The standard is divided into 10 sections, including scope, normative references, terms and definitions, energy management system, management responsibility, planning, support, operation, performance evaluation and improvement. Each section includes specific requirements that organizations must meet in order to be certified to the standard. Organizations that meet the requirements of ISO 50001:2018 can be certified to the standard, which demonstrates their commitment to energy management and sustainability. It helps organizations to establish the systems and processes necessary to improve energy performance, including energy efficiency, use, and consumption.</p>
        <p class="responsive-paragraph">ISO 50001:2018 is an international standard for Energy Management Systems (EnMS) that can be applied to any organization regardless of its size, type, or location. It's designed to help organizations systematically manage their energy use and costs, and to improve energy efficiency. It's widely used in various industries, including:</p>
